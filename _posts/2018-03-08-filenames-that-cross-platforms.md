> The most conservative file naming conventions provide the most cross-platform compatibility.

## TL;DR

- To compatible with old system shall follow **8.3 rule**
- Otherwise, limit filenames to the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore ( _ ), period ( . ), and hyphen ( - ).

## Raise the questions

I developed a module to our software, in which it collects images from a file system and concatenates its caption to file name, then zips all files. Users can download this zip file and unzip it.

Simple as? Nah! I need to answer the following questions

1. How long can a directory name be?
2. How long can a file name be?
3. Can I use special characters in the directory name or file name?

## Research on MAC, LINUX and Windows

### Linux

- Linux has a maximum filename length of 255 characters for most filesystems
- **eCryptfs** recommends filenames shall no longer than 143, otherwise, it requires more than 255 characters to encrypt

### Windows 10

- Filename length is limited to 255 characters
- **MAX_PATH** is defined as 260 characters  
- **Reserved Characters**:
  - `< (less than)`,
  - `> (greater than)`,
  - `: (colon)`,
  - `" (double quote)`,
  - `/ (forward slash)`,
  - `\ (backslash)`,
  - `| (vertical bar or pipe)`,
  - `? (question mark)`,
  - `* (asterisk)`

### Give it a go on MAC

I'm using MAC with MAC OS X, so I just gave it a go.

Conclusions:

- Filename allows everything, except: `/`  
- Need to escape some special characters, like `\?`, `\*`. Otherwise, it behaves weirdly
- Mac max directory name length: 255
- Mac max file name length: 255

**Not Allowed:** `/`

  ```bash
  moss$ mkdir "/"
  mkdir: /: Is a directory
  
  moss$ mkdir "//"
  mkdir: //: Is a directory
  
  moss$ mkdir "/4"
  mkdir: /4: Permission denied
  
  moss$ mkdir haha/haha
  mkdir: haha: No such file or directory
  ```

**Weird parts**

If a file named **?** exists, you cannot do `mkdir *`, which will return `mkdir: ?: File exists`

  ```bash
  moss$ ls -a
  . ..
  moss$ mkdir ?
  moss$ ls -a
  . .. ?
  moss$ mkdir *
  mkdir: ?: File exists
  moss$ ls -a
  . .. ?
  moss$ rm -rf ?
  moss$ mkdir *
  moss$ ls -a
  * . ..
  ```
  
**Mac max file name length: 255.**

```bash
touch [256_charactors_here] //File name too long
touch [255_charactors_here_including_extension] //File created
```

## Research result

1. Most restrict rule is known as **8.3**, which shall always work on any platform.
2. Avoid using "special" non-alphanumeric characters, they may be reserved for special purposes depending on the OS.
3. Avoid using white space characters such as **spaces**, **tabs**, **new lines** and **embedded returns**.
4. Filenames must not lead with `.(dot)`, `-`
5. Directory and file names should not be too long, **140 is recommand**.
6. Using filename extension, like `.jpg` and `.doc`
7. Must not use periods in directory (folder) names

## Java implementation

### Replace replace everything but [a-zA-Z0-9.-]

```java
myString = myString.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9\\.\\-]", "_");
```
