Should use Enums any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants

## What is an Enum

An enum type (or enumerated type) is a type whose fields consist of a fixed set of constants. Eg: Seasons of a year. In plain English, "to enumerate" means to count off or name one by one from a list.

1. We can add fields, constructors and methods to an enum.
2. Enum can also implement interfaces.
3. When anything else other than constants is there, comma-separated constants should be terminated with a semicolon. Otherwise, the semicolon is optional.
4. We can use `==` to compare enum constants effectively because constants are final and we cannot call an enum’s constructors to create more constants.
5. Enums supports switch statement.

```java
public enum Season {
    SPRING,
    SUMMER,
    AUTUMN,
    WINTER;
}
```

### Enum fields and methods

Enum constructor:

```java
protected Enum(String name, int ordinal)
```

Parameters:

1. `name`
    - The name of this enum constant, which is the identifier used to declare it.
    - Should use toString to return a more user-friendly name.

2. `ordinal`:
    - Its position in its enum declaration, starts from 0.
    - Should avoid to use it.
    - It is designed for use by sophisticated enum-based data structures, such as `EnumSet` and `EnumMap`.

Overridden methods:

1. `clone ()` – Throws `CloneNotSupportedException`. This guarantees that enums are never cloned, which is necessary to preserve their "singleton" status.
2. `equals ()` – Returns true if the specified object is equal to this enum constant.
3. `finalize ()` – to ensure that constants cannot be finalized.
4. `hashCode ()` – because equals is overridden
5. `toString ()` – to return constant’s name.
6. `compareTo()` – Enum implements Comparable.

Important methods

1. `name()` – returns constant’s name.

2. `ordinal()` – position of the constant within enum type. compareTo () compares ordinals.

3. `The values()` static method of the enum returns an array of all constants that are declared in the enum. It's not part of Enum’s java documentation. It's added by the compiler.

    ```java
    for (Planet p : Planet.values()) {
        System.out.printf("Your weight on %s is %f%n", p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));
    }
    ```

4. `getDeclaringClass()` - Returns the Class object corresponding to this enum constant's enum type.
    - Two enum constants e1 and e2 are of the same enum type if and only if `e1.getDeclaringClass() == e2.getDeclaringClass()`
    - The value returned by this method may differ from the one returned by the Object.getClass() method for enum constants with constant-specific class bodies.

### JSON Representation of Enum

Enums are POJOs. They can be represented as a JSON.

### Benefits of using Enum

1. More readable code.
2. Enum is type-safe. You cannot assign anything else other than predefined Enum constants to an Enum variable
3. Set of Constant declaration.
4. Can be usable in switch-case.

## Persisting Enums in JPA

1. persist the ordinal with `@Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)`
2. persist the String with `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)`.
3. JPA 2.1 `@Converter` Annotation
4. Database specification for Enum data type // todo
    1. Postgres
    2. MySQL

### Ordinal

The Good

- `ORDINAL`  can use a SMALLINT which is the most compact db option.
- Rename filed without pressure.

The Bad

- New enum elements must be added to the end of the list. If we add a new value in the middle or rearrange the enum’s order, we’ll break the existing data model.
- Removing existing elements from ann Enum will require to shift all entries in case you are using `ORDINAL`.

The Others

- `@Enumerated` column does not need to take the `ORDINAL` EnumType value since that’s used by default.

### String Value

1. A string is bigger than, like, int. So will use more space and hence slower.
2. Renaming an enum value will still break the database data.

### Using `@Converter`

```java
public enum Season {
    SPRING("1"),
    SUMMER("2"),
    AUTUMN("3"),
    WINTER("4");

    private String code;

    Season(String code) {
        this.code = code;
    }
}
```

```java
@Entity @Data
public class Flower {
    @Id private Long id;
    private Season season;
}
```

```java
@Converter(autoApply = true)
public class SeasonConverter implements AttributeConverter<Season, String> {
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Season attribute) {
        if (attribute == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return attribute.getCode();
    }

    @Override
    public Season convertToEntityAttribute(String dbData) {
        if (dbData == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return Stream.of(Season.values())
                .filter(s -> s.getCode().equalsIgnoreCase(dbData))
                .findFirst()
                .orElseThrow(IllegalArgumentException::new);
    }
}
```

```java
@Test
public void canSave() {

 Flower flower = new Flower();
 flower.setId(1L);
 flower.setSeason(Season.SPRING);

 final Flower save = flowerRepository.save(flower);

 Assert.assertTrue(save != null);
}
```
